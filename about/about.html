<h1>About Us</h1>

<h2 id="left">Mission</h2>
<p>The Furry Paw Protectors's mission is to educate the public about altenatives to declawing and why the procedure is inhumane. So many people, including animal lovers, aren't aware that declawing is a surgical in which the animal's toes are amputated at the last joint. A portion of the bone, not just the nail, is removed. Declawing results in permanent damage such as lameness, arthritis, and other long-term complications. The practice is common practice in the United States but is illegal in many countries. In Great Britain's veternarians have declared declawing "unnecessary mutilation." </p>
 
<p>n a misguided attempt to keep big cats such as lions and tigers, as pets, their owners have the animals declawed as cubs, believing that they will be protected against injury. Later, when the cats prove to be poor pets, weighing hundreds of pounds and eating 20 pounds of meat a day, they are often neglected, confiscated by animal regulatory officials, or abandoned. They often end up in animal compounds or sanctuaries.</p>
